                                    There are several ways to fund your property purchase, including the use of a mortgage. Cash is the easiest way to buy the property but you have to show the source of money to satisfy the Money Laundering Regulation. You can show cash in different ways:
                                </p>
                                <p>Having a house before and sold it</p>

                                <p>In case when you have no sufficient source funds in liquidation and high street lander will offer you short terms / long terms loan based on your financial situation. Some lenders can offer you with their lowest down payment with 5% and help to buy an offer is also available.
                                    The mortgage loan is spread over a long period of time and mortgages can last for 25 to 30 years.

                                </p>
                                <p>The mortgage allows you to buy an expensive house as compared to if you do not have sufficient money in your account. </p>

                            <h3><b> Guarantor</b></h3>
                            <div class="fourth">
                                <p>If you have no sufficient money to pay a down payment for your house you are looking for mortgage, then a guarantor may help to get in.
                                    The good sign is that the guarantor will not be added on your deed, neither he will be co-sharer but he will be added into legal agreement that if you are not able to keep the payment update then he will make the payment on your behalf

                                </p>

                                    In the deposit contribution, a solicitor will make sure the source and the nature of the funds are available to you.
                                </p>
                                <p>What basis money is given or you need to pay back in near future, if you repay any interest will apply or if value of the property has been increased then do you have to pay back the original amount or any additional charges or in case if lose the value?</p>
                                <p>Is there a possibility plan in case the person lending you the money ever needs it back before they intended?</p>
                                <p>Put a written agreement in place confirming what has been agreed.</p>
                                <p>The person lending the money could pay to have a ‘second charge’ put on the property to guarantee that any money that has been lent is paid back when the property is sold and the mortgage (the first charge) has been paid off.</p>
