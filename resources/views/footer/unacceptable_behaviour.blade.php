                               <p>We definitely won’t tolerate aggressive behaviour while we are helping you, for example:</p>
                                <p>
                                    <li>Offensive language or swearing</li>
                                    <li>discrimination like racism or sexism </li>
                                    <li>being violent or using intimidating violence
                                        We’ll also inform you if you’re speaking to us and taking up a considerable time this may delay us to solve other people queries. For example, if you:
                                         </li>
                                    <li>keep arguing with advisor to handle your queries in very quick time </li>
                                    <li>You may demand such kind of information that is sensitive or confidential so we aren’t allowed to share except government authorities </li>
                                    <li>raising issues unrelated or out of context again and again</li>
                                    <li>raising such issue which we are unable to help you or we have closed.</li>
                                    <li>Raising some multiple complaints to us without giving us the chance to resolve them
                                        What we’ll do if your behaviour is unacceptable
                                        We’ll give you a chance to change your behaviour and if you remain unstoppable we might:
                                         </li>
                                    <li>we will end the conversation with you</li>
                                    <li>we may take serious action against you to protect our staff who are conducting your queries with professional manners </li>
                                    <li>how long you have engaged our staff without any reason</li>
                                    <li>we will write you through post or email regarding your concern you may have with us. </li>
                                    <li>only help you with certain issues </li>

                                    <li>In some point we might stop helping you completely </li>
                                    <li>call the police and take legal action against you</li>

                                        If we make a decision suspend your account, then you can’t get access of our services and your data may be kept for certain time limit according to law.
                                        We’ll give you a chance to change your behaviour before we stop helping you - unless your behaviour threatens the safety of our staff or other people.
                                        We’ll never treat you with unfair way and we will inform you why we’ve stopped helping you.
                                        If you think our decision is unfair
                                        You can write to us with full explanation that you felt that we did not treat and dealt your queries fairly. We will consider your complaint seriously and update you accordingly. Find our contact details for your advice.
